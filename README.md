## About the Game

### How to play
Use the ü°∞ and ü°≤ keys to run and the ü°± key to jump. To banish the spirits, use the **spacebar**.

You must banish all of the spirits in the realm in order to continue to the next level.

The game ends when you get possessed by an evil spirit. This happens when the spirit touches you while you're not attacking.

If your score is among the top 10 your name will appear at the end of the game.

## Future features
Bring to life more aspects of the Grimorium Verum:

Initially, the game was going to be about collecting magical items necesary for a demonic evocation, however, due to time constraints, it wasn't possible. The evocation would result on a demonic Boss appearing, which the wizard would have to defeat in order to bind it (as is detailed in the grimorium). In the present version, the game only serves to showcase what the game mechanics would look like in a finished version of the Grimorium Verum.
