## Future features
Bring to life more aspects of the Grimorium Verum:

Initially, the game was going to be about collecting magical items necesary for a demonic evocation, however, due to time constraints, it wasn't possible. The evocation would result on a demonic Boss appearing, which the wizard would have to defeat in order to bind it (as is detailed in the grimorium). In the present version, the game only serves to showcase what the game mechanics would look like in a finished version of the Grimorium Verum.
